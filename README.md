# FiveThings
A web app to keep track of my daily life (five things at a time)

Since January 2016 I've been summarizing my day into five points. I started by hand writing them everyday, but life got too busy and so I began writing them down in google keep. After nearly a year and half of doing that I decided to make it into my own web app, enjoy!

I also wrote some js code to convert my json to pdfs that I can print into physical books. Find that code in /pdf
